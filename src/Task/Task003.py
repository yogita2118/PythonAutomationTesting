 Task #3
1) Explain the difference between the = operator and the == operator in Python.
2) What does the ** operator do in Python, and how is it used?
3) What does the ^ operator do in Python, and in what context is it commonly used?

Answer:
1)
The " = " operator is used for assignment, such as when assigning a value to a variable.

The " == " operator is the relational operator for checking equality of two values.
If the values are the same, it will return True, and will return False otherwise.

Examples:
=> Assignment
   number = 3

=> Comparison
   number == 30 : False

2)
The " ** " operator in Python is used for exponentiation.
It raises the number on the left to the power of the number on the right.

Example:

=>  result = 3 ** 3
    print(result)

    Output: 27

3)
The " ^ " operator in Python is a bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operator.
Contexts for Use:
Cryptography: XOR is often used in simple encryption algorithms.
Checksum Calculations: XOR can be used to calculate checksums or for error detection.
Swapping Values: XOR can swap two variables without needing a temporary variable.

Example:

=> result = 5 ^ 3
   print(result)

   Output: 6
